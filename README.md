# .dotfiles

Opinionated, and probably not the way you like 'em. But... if you do, have at it!

- Homebrew
- Vim uses vim-plug for packages
- NeoVim (because GitHub Copilot), `vim` is aliased to `nvim` in the `.aliases` file, also uses ~/.vimrc configuration.
- Tmuxinator (because easier to script opening multiple tmux windows/panes)
- iTerm2

## Getting started

**New Computer?**

1. Clone this repo

   ```
   mkdir -p ~/Projects && cd ~/Projects && git clone git@github.com:afomera/dotfiles.git
   ```

2. Run the installation command for Terminal Tools

   ```
    cd ~/Projects/dotfiles && ./install-terminal-tools.sh
   ```

   It will install Homebrew, Oh my zsh, zsh-autosuggestions and ASDF along with the ruby and nodejs plugins.

3. Restart your Terminal, and install-dotfiles

   ```
     cd ~/Projects/dotfiles && ./install-dotfiles.rb
   ```

   This adds linked files to your local dotfiles clone, and will install the configuration files for NeoVim, SSH, tmux etc.

   If you need to uninstall... run: `cd ~/Projects/dotfiles && ./install-dotfiles.rb uninstall`

Then restart your Terminal and proceed to the next step!

## Highlights about what each file does

**Oh my ZSH!**

- ~/.zshrc default configuration with a change so the paths will work regardless of computer username
- Also includes the code to pick up changes in the ~/.bin folder we make, and our ~/.aliases and ~/.env-vars files.

**Vim**

_Requires Neovim_

- ~/.vimrc will auto-install vim-plug
- ~/.vimrc/colors/monokai.vim -- theme for the monokai syntax highlighting.
- plugins live in the ~/.vimrc.bundles file
- Leader key has been re-mapped to <space>

**Tmux**

- ~/.tmux.conf - sets the tmux settings, still using the default cntrl+b keys.

**Terminal**

- ~/.hushlogin to quiet the iTerm2 login message
- ~/.aliases.local is where we put system specific overrides (ie for work projects etc)
- ~/.env-vars for putting ENVs we need for other things.

**Rails/Ruby specific things**

- ~/.gemrc will make it so we don't install documentation for rubygems
- ~/.railsrc ensures we always use postgresql for our db for rails apps unless we specify different
- ~/.irbrc helps tell us when we're in a safe Rails console session or if we're in production (not pry compatible)

**Git**

- ~/.gitconfig - for the usual git setups, as well as the name + email of Git author
- ~/.gitmessage - for the default prompt for git commit messages
