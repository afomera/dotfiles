## My dotfiles

These are my dotfiles... WIP but trying to organize my files across
multiple computers has finally frustrated me enough to fix this mess.

## Software Used
**Editors**
- [Atom](http://atom.io)
- MacVim `brew install macvim`
  - [Janus (plugins)](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus)
      Install script: `curl -L https://bit.ly/janus-bootstrap | bash`

**Terminal**
- [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
- [Oh my zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

**Package Management**
- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)

## General Notes
- Leader key for mvim defaults to \
- Switching between panes/windows in macvim is Ctrl-w-w
- Running shell commands in VIM - Esc (out of mode you're in to normal..)
  :!(command) for example typing :!touch
app/controllers/home_controller.rb will create a file like a normal
touch command.
- Selecting text and indenting: Enter visual mode (V) select the text
  (you can press `jj` and it'll select three lines and you can then
press > to indent or < to remove one set of indention.
- Auto-indenting all text: `(V) - Cmd+A - =`
